## Question1

# In this challenge I am writing a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'

## Question2
# In this challenge I'm writing a fuction that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them .For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7] and -4 and 7 should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

## Question3

# In this challenge I'm writing a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns new array containing only prime numbers from the original array. The function accurately idintifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order as the appear in the input array. For example if you provide an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] it should return an array [2, 3, 5, 7] .
